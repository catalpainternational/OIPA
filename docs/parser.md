## Technical information

The parser is located at `\iati\parser\`. It used to combine parser and validation. Currently (02-11-2016) we're working on a POST API in OIPA for both the activity and organisation standard. The current plan is to separate validation while doing that so we can use validation both on the parser and the POST API.



TODO: 

This chapter is yet to be written: it will contain information on IATI versions supported in the parser and high level tech info on how the parser works.
